# nostr link icon

The nostr protocol supports an evolving and decentralised ecosystem of clients and uses, currently with no obliged or agreed protocol-wide visual identity. This proposal responds to discussion of the need for a simple and distinctive web icon, that might be included amongst other webpage social media and site link icons, for use in linking to content and profiles within any of the available nostr social media clients and content platforms.

This graphic is conceived to explicitly not assert the nostr protocol as a brand; aiming to suggest a more general and open point of connection, to any nostr content instance, across any of the many uses and clients available, without asserting or undermining particular client identities. It proposes a distinctive yet familiar pair of square brackets, separated to contain an unfilled content area, to a distance that results in the outer limits of the brackets occupying a square.

A test selection of PNG and SVG files are included, in a range of example tones and tints.
