# nostr share icon

The nostr protocol supports an evolving and decentralised ecosystem of clients and use cases, currently with no obliged or agreed protocol wide visual identity. 
Developers and users are actively contributing and proposing supporting visuals as the need and opportunity arises. 
This release proposes a general nostr share icon, for use in linking to content and profiles within any of the available nostr social media clients and content platforms...

This graphic engages a distinctive yet familiar pair of square brackets, separated to contain an unfilled content area, to a distance that results in their outer limits occupying a square...

A starting selection of high resolution PNG and SVG file are included here, in a range of tones, of an example icon button and the icon graphic itself.
